#Python Program to Count the Number of Occurrence of a each Character in String

1)by using counter method

from collections import Counter

s = "programizz"

a = Counter(s)

print(a)

o/p : Counter({'r': 2, 'z': 2, 'p': 1, 'o': 1, 'g': 1, 'a': 1, 'm': 1, 'i': 1})

2)by using dict 
 i)with get(): get method will give the corresponing value of key 

get() method is used to check the previously occurring character in string, if its new, 
it assigns 0 as initial and appends 1 to it, else appends 1 to previously holded value of that element in dictionary.

s = "programizz"

dictt = {}

for i in s:
    dictt[i] = dictt.get(i,0)+1
print(dictt)
	
 ii)without get()

s = "programizz"

dictt = {}

for i in s:
    if i not in dictt.keys():
        dictt[i] = 1
    else:
        dictt[i] = dictt[i] +1
print(dictt)
