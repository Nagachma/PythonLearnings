1)Travel all values one by one while travelling compare first travelled value with remaining all other values whether it is max or not if it is max 

then then store value as max if not go for next value for compare



ex:

l1 = [3,1,5,7,2,1]
nl = []
ln = len(l1)-1

while ln>=0:
    i = 0
    max = l1[i] #first travelled value
    for i in l1:
        if i<max:  # comparing first travelled value with other values
            max = i
    nl.append(max)
    l1.remove(max)
    ln = ln-1
    i = i+1

print(nl)
