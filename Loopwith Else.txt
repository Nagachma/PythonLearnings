

loops with else block:
Inside loop execution,if break statement not executed ,then only else part will be executed.


else means loop without break(if there is no break in loop else will execute)

scenario:if we want to know all condition are satisfied then we can use for else 


cart = [1,4,5,6]

for i in cart:
    print(i)
    if i>10:
        break
else:
    print("there is no break in for loop ")
