argv using sys module to catch command line arguments

saving two values from keyboard

eval function to evaluate string and catch list,tuple,set from command line


if there is one condition then we go for if , or more than we go for if elif ,example programms biggest and smallest numbers
 
loops on for , while if we want perform action on object then we should for for or if we want ferform until a contion falls then we should go for elif

if we want come out of loop then we should go for break , if we want skip some iteration then we should go for continue

else with for and while loop , if break statement doesnt execute in loop then it will go else   

find and index both will give index of substring , whereas substring doesnt exist in find it will give -1 and in index it will give valueerror 

index,find,len,strip,cases,slicing,split,join,count,replace,isalpha,isdigit,isalnum,islower,isupper,isspace


index, count,len,append,insert,remove,pop ,extend in list

in set add for single element update for muliple elements , remove will remove a element if not will give keyerror in discard will not give error


in dictionary d[] if key is not there it will give error , d.get(key) it will not give error , we can convert a list of tuple into dict


function returning multiple values 

ternary operators in python

try,except,finally,else --else block will be executed if and only if there are no exceptions inside try block, final block will execute always 

try ,else will execute same time

userdefined exceptions : we have to inherts a class called Exception while using we ahve to use raise keyword

threading , multitasking(separate programs),multithreading(same program of different parts) function based and class based threading available 

synchronization in threading , multiple threads will be executed one by one so that we can overcome inconsistancy of data this can be acive by using lock ,rlock,semaphore

oops: operator overriding :__add__(),method overriding :same method in base class and we are overriding in child class 

method overloading(mutliple functions with same name different signatures in same class ) and method overriding(same method same signature in different parent and child class) 

abstract method and abstract class , we ahve to import from abc module for abstract class ,abstract method with abstract class we cant inherit 

From child class constuctor we can call parent class constructor by using super() method.
