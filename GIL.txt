The GIL is a mutex (mutual exclusion) that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once.

The Python Global Interpreter Lock or GIL, in simple words, is a mutex (or a lock) that allows only one thread to hold the control of the Python interpreter. This means that only one thread can be in a state of execution at any point in time.
