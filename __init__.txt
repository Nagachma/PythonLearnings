it is a constructor 

__init__ in inheritance

if parent class and child class has both __init__ mehods , if we create child class object then child __init_ method will be called , if we want call parent 
__init__ and child __init__ then we have to use super keyword in child class __init_ method , then both the constructors will be executed

if we are inheriting two classes __init_ method into child class and we are using super keyword then MRO (Left side ) class method will be executed

in the same way if have two same method names in parents class if we are calling by using child class object that time also left side method will be invoked
