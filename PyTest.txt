in pytest we are just checking functionality wheather true or false 


we are calling the function if it is matches to our exception handling result 


like pytest.raprse(someerror) as err:
	function calling 


if out error.value  is matches to our function expected result 

===========================================

with pytest(error) as err # this error should occur when call the bellow fun

	downloadfunc# this is th fun to call

asser exception should math the == function output
