Datastructures are building blocks or raw material for any buildingblocks


Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. 
It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.


Note: Data structure and data types are slightly different. 
Data structure is the collection of data types arranged in a specific order.


Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:

Linear data structure
Non-linear data structure


1)Linear data structures:



In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.

However, when the complexity of the program increases, the linear data structures might not be the best choice because of operational complexities.



Stack, Queue, Array, Linkedlist




2)Non linear data structures:



Unlike linear data structures, elements in non-linear data structures are not in any sequence. Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements.

Non-linear data structures are further divided into graph and tree based data structures.
